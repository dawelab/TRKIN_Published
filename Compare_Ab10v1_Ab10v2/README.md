# These scripts use Mummer to compare the Ab10 v1 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02029-9) genome to the Ab10 v2 genome generated in this publication.
1. This script uses mummer to compare the Ab10 v1 genome to the Ab10 v2 genome.
2. These scripts BLAST various relevant features against the Ab10 v1 and Ab10 v2 genomes so that they can be marked on the plot.
3. This script produces a dotplot from the Mummer output (1) and annotates both genomes using the results from the BLAST scripts above.
4. These files contain the final output images.
