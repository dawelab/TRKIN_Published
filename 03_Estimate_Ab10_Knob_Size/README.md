### These files estimate the repeat abundance in three Ab10 containing lines in the W23 inbred background. Ab10 and Ab10-Df(L) have the knob180. Ab10-Df(K) lacks the knob180. Thus qualitifying abundance of knob180 repeats in these three lines will provide an estimate of the size of the knob180. 
1. This script identifies all of the repeats in the raw illumina reads and removes overlapping hits
2. These scripts quantify the number of hits for each repeat type
3. This provides a summary table of the results from the 2 scripts
