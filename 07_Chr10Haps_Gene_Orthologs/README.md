# These scripts identify and plots gene ortholog pairs between chromosome 10 haplotypes.
1. These scripts identify genes on driving chr10 haplotypes
   > 1.Ab10
   > 2.K10L2
2.These scripts extract the protein sequences associated with the genes on driving chr10 haplotypes.
   > 1.  Ab10
   > 2.  K10L2
3. These scripts identify the longest isoform of proteins on all chr10 haplotypes
  >  1. Ab10
  >  2. K10L2
  >  3. N10
4. These scripts extract the protein sequences assocaited with the longest isoform for all chr10 haplotypes
   >  1. Ab10
   >  2. K10L2
   >  3. N10
5. This script runs orthofinder for all pairwise comparisons of chr10 haplotypes
6. These scripts plot the gene ortholog pairs between chr10 haplotypes
